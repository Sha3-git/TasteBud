Effective Date: 27 February 2026
1. Introduction
Welcome to TasteBud. This Privacy and Security Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and Saskatchewan's Health Information Protection Act (HIPA).
2. Information We Collect
To provide a highly effective food allergy and symptom tracker, we must collect the following:
  * Personal Information: Name, email address, and account credentials.
 * Health Information: Data related to food allergies, dietary intolerances, symptom logs, reaction severity, and medical notes you choose to enter.
 * Device and Usage Data: IP address, device type, operating system, and app interaction metrics (used strictly for app improvement).
3. How We Use Your Information
We adhere to the principle of data minimization, using your information only for the following explicit purposes:
 * To provide and maintain the TasteBud tracking features.
 * To personalize your experience and generate insights regarding your food sensitivities.
 * To communicate with you regarding updates, security alerts, and support messages.
 * We will never sell or rent your personal or health information to third parties.
4. Data Security and Safeguards
We implement robust, industry-standard security measures to protect your data as required by HIPA and PIPEDA:
 * Encryption: All personal health information is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
 * Access Controls: Strict role-based access ensures that only authorized personnel (if any) can access backend infrastructure, and no one can view your readable health data.
 * Data Storage: Stored on MongoDB
5. Explicit Consent and Data Sharing
By creating a TasteBud account, you provide explicit consent for the collection and use of your health data for the purposes outlined above. We do not share your health information unless:
 * You explicitly authorize us to share it (e.g., exporting a report to share with your healthcare provider).
 * We are legally required to do so by regulatory authorities or law enforcement.
6. Your Rights
Under PIPEDA and HIPA, you maintain full control over your data. You have the right to:
 * Access: Request a copy of the personal and health information we hold about you.
 * Correction: Update or correct any inaccurate information in your symptom logs or profile.
 * Deletion: Request the permanent deletion of your account and all associated health data.
