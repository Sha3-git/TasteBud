                <td><p>The following project aims to help in understanding food allergies and intolerances. Food allergies and intolerances have become more common place and without a diagnosis from a doctor it can be difficult to narrow down what the specific allergy or intolerance is.</p></td></tr>

                <td><p>A food tracker that in tandem with a symptom tracker, will help to narrow down specific allergies/intolerances to particular ingredients/foods.</p></td></tr>
                <tr><td><p><strong>Options</strong></p></td>
                  <td><p>Build an application that is suited towards building a lifestyle to help mitigate allergies and food intolerances. Build an application that is suited towards building out diets to manage allergies/intolerances. Build an application that helps to correlate allergies and their symptoms through day to day food intake and symptoms.</p></td></tr>

              <tr><td colspan="2"><p></p>
                <p>Option 1: User Lifestyle App:</p><p>Costs:</p>
                <ul><li>Would require some direct connection to a doctor/allergist to provide accurate diagnoses</li><li>Would require a large dataset for user's height, weight, activity level, etc.., desired health goals, as well as their current allergies, symptoms, along with tracking their diet.</li>
                  <li>User's might not achieve their desired goals as every individual has varied diets and varied metabolic differences</li><li>Long development time, as each individual part is quite intensive and would require a lot of attention to detail and testing to ensure that accurate data is being presented</li>
                  <li>User would be required to essentially document their entire day</li></ul>
                <p>Benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Would provide the users with a large amount of insights and would allow them to more accurately figure out what their body responds to best</li>
                  <li>Would root out some issues with allergies, intolerances, symptoms, etc.. as a result of exercise or lack thereof.</li></ul>
                <p>Option 2: Diet Builder App:</p><p>Costs:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Would require some direct connection to a dietician</li>
                  <li>Would require a personalized food intake for each person</li>
                  <li>Would require a large dataset for foods, their nutritional facts, what their allergens are, dietary preferences, cultural preferences, portions.</li><li>Long testing and development time, as it would be necessary to test out a variety of diets (i.e vegan, halal, kosher, vegetarian, pescatarian, etc..) and ensure that the recommendations made would be accurate to what the user would want and nutritionally needs. As well, budgeting would need to be implemented as some diets may cost more than others and some users would not be able to feasibly afford certain foods</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Would provide the users with diets that could not only help mitigate their allergies/intolerances but as well potentially introduce users to new foods.</li>
                  <li>Has some potential to be paired with restaurants, as it could be used in conjunction with a menu to point users to restaurants that could fit their needs</li>
                  <li>Would give the user a good guideline to figuring out their allergies and food intolerances.</li></ul>
                <p>Option 3: Allergy and Symptom Correlation App</p>
                <p>Costs:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Would require a lot of data to be able to accurately correlate allergies and their symptoms. Would need a dataset for allergies and food intolerances, foods themselves, and cross reactivity.</li>
                  <li>Could be inaccurate if users forget to input data/input incorrect data</li>
                  <li>Medium-long development time, as integration between allergies, symptoms and foods may be difficult and requires intensive pattern recognition. As well, large amounts of testing and research would be needed to ensure that data is correct and accurate, and recommendations follow what the allergies and symptoms entail.</li>
                  <li>Requires some level of day-day tracking by the user to ensure accuracy in data</li></ul>
                <p>Benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Would provide users with strong diagnostic assistance for food-related allergies and intolerances.</li>
                  <li>Would fit in a growing market, as food allergies and intolerances are on the rise.</li>
                  <li>Data collected could be used to help with diagnoses from allergists, clinics, doctors, etc..</li></ul></td></tr>

                <p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p></td></tr>
            <tr><td colspan="2">
              <p>Our recommendation is to build and develop the Allergy and Symptom Correlation App as we believe that it is not only the most realistic option given, but it also allows for future development and improvements, and could evolve into an application that suggests diets, or even be a user food profile application. The Allergy and Symptom Correlation aspects will create a solid framework and base, and make it simple to iterate onto, and will not limit the scope as much as the other options would.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
